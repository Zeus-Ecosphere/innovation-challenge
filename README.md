[![Minima_Innovation_Challenge_Calling all innovators](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92978315/178734996-2a801dcd-ad85-45c2-bfb1-951350e71380.png)](https://innovation.minima.global/)

## About
Come and build on [Minima](https://www.minima.global/), the world's first truly decentralized blockchain network, enabling everyone to freely connect and prosper. Minima is accountable, autonomous, inclusive, resilient, scalable, secure, uncensored and lightweight.

The Minima Innovation Challenge is a month-long competition designed to find brilliant and unique applications for the protocol, outside of what has already been conceived. Now is your chance to shine!

The Minima Innovation Challenge is designed to support and encourage individuals and teams to create innovative solutions using the Minima Protocol. The challenge will be split into two phases.

**Dates and Timings**

Submission Period: 13/07/22 to 02/08/22

Phase 1 Ideation: 18/07/22 to 05/08/22

Phase 2 Coding: 09/08/22 to 30/08/22

Judging/Voting Period: 31/08/22 to 06/09/22

Winners Announced: 15/09/22

Distribution of Prizes: Soon after “Winners Announced”.
‍
Dates and timings are subject to change. All changes will be communicated to participants. 

**Phase 1: Ideation**

Over the course of three weeks, teams will have access to educational resources and office hours with the Minima and EdenBase teams to brainstorm and ask questions.

At the end of the three weeks, teams will not need to deliver any code yet, however you will need to share a brief presentation of the idea accompanied by a written description. This includes a discussion of market fit, why the idea is uniquely suited for the Minima Protocol, and what the competitive landscape looks like.

From the Ideation phase, the top 10 projects will receive $1000 each of Minima token and be invited to Phase 2.


**Phase 2: Coding**

These 10 teams will then build their solutions using Minima, and provide at least a Proof of Concept (PoC) at the end of the sprint.

From the projects that submitted a PoC, the top 5 will be invited to a week-long series of feedback and mentorship sessions that will provide them with further technical support and business support in developing the MiniDapp use case and code.

The judges will then choose the top 3 teams, who will be awarded a financial prize, and teams that show more long-term thinking, including ideas around how to productize their idea, will have a higher chance of winning.
