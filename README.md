# Minima Innovation Challenge
[![Minima_Innovation_Challenge_Calling all devs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92978315/177553115-5a2ada7f-b7fd-46ad-9fd3-abc559ad1ccf.png)](https://innovation.minima.global/)

## About
Come and build on [Minima](https://www.minima.global/), the world's first truly decentralized blockchain network, enabling everyone to freely connect and prosper. Minima is accountable, autonomous, inclusive, resilient, scalable, secure, uncensored and lightweight.

The Minima Innovation Challenge is a month-long competition designed to find brilliant and unique applications for the protocol, outside of what has already been conceived. Now is your chance to shine!

The Minima Innovation Challenge is designed to support and encourage individuals and teams to create innovative solutions using the Minima Protocol. The challenge will be split into two phases.

**Phase 1: Ideation**

Over the course of two weeks, teams will have access to educational resources and office hours with the Minima and EdenBase teams to brainstorm and ask questions. At the end of the two weeks, teams will not need to deliver any code yet, however you will need to share a brief presentation of the idea accompanied by a written description. This includes a discussion of market fit, why the idea is uniquely suited for the Minima Protocol, and what the competitive landscape looks like. From the Ideation phase, the top 10 projects will receive $1000 each of Minima token and be invited to Phase 2.

**Phase 2: Coding**

These 10 teams will then build their solutions using Minima, and provide at least a Proof of Concept (PoC) at the end of the sprint. From the projects that submitted a PoC, the top 5 will be invited to a week-long series of feedback and mentorship sessions that will provide them with further technical support and business support in developing the dApp use case and code. The judges will then choose the top 3 teams, who will be awarded a financial prize, and teams that show more long-term thinking, including ideas around how to productize their idea, will have a higher chance of winning. We can’t wait to see your submissions! And remember, on Minima, every user participates in constructing the blockchain by running a node (there is no mining). There must be no entity that is paid to construct the chain. The parts of the protocol critical for consensus must not require changes.

Concessions may be made if an idea is amazing, even if the deployment of it still requires extra support.

1. Innovation – is this a novel idea?

2. Application of Minima Protocol – is this project utilizing Minima correctly? Does it embrace Minima’s full potential? 

3. Market fit – is this something that is needed on the market? Was the productization strategy presented?

4. Quality of presentation – was the pitch convincing? Does the team want to move this to the next level?

5. Quality of code – is the project coded in a professional way?

6. Roadmap – are the next steps clear and actionable?

## Entry Instructions & Prizes
To submit your application, follow [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdW-r1iTN2JUxaLhKZxLj4FgRnIF6yZWAXB30hj4c-vwaNuPw/viewform) and complete the form by **2nd August 2022.**

The total prize pool is USD$40,000 in Minima Token.

The Top 10 teams from the Ideation Phase will receive $1,000 worth of Minima Token and will move on to the Coding Phase of the Innovation Challenge.

From the Coding Phase, judges will choose the Top 5 teams that will receive an invitation to a Boot Camp organised by EdenBase at a later date.

At the Boot Camp, participants will have the opportunity to access our top experts, join coding and business workshops, and co-work in the EdenBase Hub in London (or remotely if the participants are not in the UK).

In addition to the prizes for the Top 10 teams, judges will award a prize pool of USD$30,000 in Minima Token.
